* [RpmSync](https://github.com/semtexzv/rpmtools/tree/master/sync) - Low overhead library for streaming processing of repositories
* [BinDB](https://github.com/semtexzv/rpmtools/tree/master/bindb) - Minimalistic typed key-value database for storing arbitrary 
rust types in performant and safe manner.
